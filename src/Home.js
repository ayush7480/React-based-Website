        <h2>INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT BLACK HOLE.</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong
          that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formation:</strong> Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that
          have undergone a supernova explosion. When a massive star collapses under
          its own gravity, it can form a black hole.

        These are just a few fascinating facts about neutron stars. The study of these extreme objec
        ts continues to deepen our understanding of the physics of matter and the universe itself.
