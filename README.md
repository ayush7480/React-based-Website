# React-based-Website


This is a beginner-level front-end website created using the React framework. It serves as my initial project to showcase various designs and effects in web development. The website features a clean and modern interface with interactive elements and visually appealing layouts. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate my understanding of React concepts and highlight my creativity in implementing different design techniques. Although it is a simple website, it reflects my enthusiasm for web development and my eagerness to explore more advanced projects in the future
